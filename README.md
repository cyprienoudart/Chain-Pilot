# Chain Pilot

**Chain Pilot** is a secure financial orchestration layer designed to connect intelligent agents (AI) with real-world financial systems — both traditional banking and crypto — without exposing sensitive credentials or losing human oversight.

This project aims to solve one of the biggest missing pieces in applied AI: **safe, controlled, autonomous financial action**.

---

## 🚀 Vision & Problem Statement
Modern AI agents can reason, plan, and execute tasks — but they cannot safely interact with money. Today, any attempt to let an AI manage payments includes massive risks:

- **AI hallucinations leading to unintended transactions**
- **Lack of sandboxed spending limits or auditability**
- **No standardized bridge between AI systems and financial rails**
- **Impossible to give partial access without exposing full account keys**
- **Banks and crypto wallets are not built for autonomous agents**

**AI Banking Bridge solves this.**

Our platform provides a secure, programmable, highly-auditable gateway that lets AI agents initiate, simulate, or execute transactions — while human owners maintain absolute control.

---

## 🔐 Core Concept
AI Banking Bridge acts as a **Secure Financial Proxy** between:
- your **AI agent**, and
- your **bank account** or **crypto wallet**.

It provides a minimal-permission environment where:
- AIs can request financial actions
- Every action is logged, validated, and optionally rate-limited
- Spending caps and risk thresholds are enforced
- The AI never touches your private keys or credentials

This unlocks safe automation for:
- recurring payments
- purchases executed by AI agents
- budget-based autonomous decisions
- webhook-triggered transactions
- API-connected AI workflows

## 🛠️ Features Overview
### **1. Secure Execution Layer**
- Isolated key management (HSM-style)
- Granular spending permissions
- Velocity limits (€/day, €/transaction)
- Emergency kill-switch
- Audit log of all agent actions

### **2. Agent-facing API**
Endpoints such as:
- `POST /transaction/simulate`
- `POST /transaction/execute`
- `GET /budget/remaining`
- `GET /history`

Designed for LLMs and autonomous agents.

### **3. Multi-Rail Support**
- **Banking**: PSD2/Open Banking APIs
- **Crypto**: Web3 integrations (EVM wallets, MPC wallets)
- **Stablecoins**: For predictable, low-volatility operations

### **4. Oversight Dashboard**
A minimalistic interface (black/white) including:
- Recent agent requests
- Spending charts
- AI transaction summaries
- Key spending indicators (KPIs)
- Risk alerts

---

## 🧩 Architecture Summary
AI Banking Bridge follows a modular architecture:

```

AI Agent → AI Proxy API → Rule Engine → Execution Layer → Banking/Crypto Rail

```

### **1. AI Proxy API**
The only surface exposed to the agent.
- Natural-language friendly schema
- Safety guardrails

### **2. Rule Engine**
Evaluates:
- spending rules
- risk thresholds
generated by AI or humans.

### **3. Secure Execution Layer**
- holds encrypted keys
- signs crypto transactions
- interacts with PSD2 APIs

### **4. Human Dashboard**
Optional confirmations, alerts, logs.

## 📚 Why This Project Matters
This project tackles two major issues limiting AI adoption:

### **1. Safety in autonomous AI transactions**
It prevents runaway actions, financial loss, or overreach.

### **2. Functional integration of AI into real-world economy**
By giving AI a safe way to spend money, we unlock:
- autonomous e-commerce
- autonomous SaaS management
- self-operating agents
- automated business processes

AI can finally *act*, not just advise.
